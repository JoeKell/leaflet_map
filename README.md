# Leaflet/Mapbox Challenge - Layered Earthquake Map

## Summary

In this project, I built a layered world map that displays all earthquakes from the last 7 days by magnitude and depth as well as the borders of the Earth's tectonic plates.

### Using the Final Application
Since the API is not free to use, the final application is not publicly available. The page opens in dark mode with both earthquakes and tectonic plate borders visible:

Clicking on any of the earthquakes will show the name of the earthquake which is uaully just a description of the location and the time that it happened. In the bottom right corner of the screen is a legend to help the user understand the depth of the earthquake. In the upper right corner of the screen is a control for the user to choose which map layer is visible and whether or not the earthquakes or tectonic plates are visible.
